# scoreController
This is the "Score Controller" part of the "Score Panels System".
The “Score Controller” software (running, on choice, on a Linux Computer, an Android Tablet or Android Phone)
controls, via WiFi, one or more “Score Panels” (composed by a Raspberry Pi3 connected to a HDMI capable monitor or TV).
Each "Score Panel" is individually configurable in such a way to show the score information only or instead the score
and, on request, slides and videos as dictated by the "Score Controller" or even live images of the game field.
